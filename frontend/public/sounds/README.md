# Notification Sound

Please copy the `notification.mp3` file from `backend/public/sounds/` to this folder.

Alternatively, you can use any notification sound file named `notification.mp3`.

The notification system will play this sound when important notifications arrive (service requests, emergency alerts, etc.).
